## Let's build with Monday.com and GPT!

---

Every programmer knows the pain of debugging. From trying identifying the culprit to trying old Stack Overflow solutions, the process can be long and frustrating. Well, we're here to help! We are going to build a NextJS app that integrates with your Monday.com bug queue board, reads a description of the problem and then automatically makes clever suggestions on how to fix it.

## What is Monday.com?

Monday.com is a customizable web and mobile work management platform, designed to help teams and organizations with operational efficiency by tracking projects and workflows, visualizing data, and team collaboration. It includes automation capabilities and supports integrations with other work apps.

## Setting up your Monday App

First, [create a Monday.com developer account(https://auth.monday.com/users/sign_up_new?developer=true?utm_medium=affiliates&utm_source=lablabai&utm_campaign=ai_app_hackathon)] if you haven't already.

After finishing setting your account, log in to your Monday.com dashboard and press the blue button on the left panel to add a new item to your workspace. Click on "Choose from template" and then select the Product Development template. Then click on "Use template".

<Img alt="Monday.com dashboard" src="" />

This should add the template on your dashboard, with a Bug Queue board, which we will use later to fetch the Bug column and send it to GPT. Add a new column to the Incoming Bugs table and name it Suggestions. Your dashboard should look like this:

<Img alt="Monday.com product development, bug queue" src="" />

Now, click on your avatar -> Developers and press the "Create app" button then give it a name (e.g Debug Assistant).

<Img alt="Monday.com create app" src="" />

Go to the OAuth section of your app, and add add the following permissions: "me:read", "boards:read" and "boards:write"

<Img alt="Monday.com OAuth" src="" />

We can now proceed to the installation.

## ðŸ¤– Installation

To get a head start, we are going to use a NextJS app template from Monday.com that provides ready-to-use React components and context, so we can focus on working with the AI part. You can later modify these to improve UI/UX.

Clone and install the template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuhgto/monday-ai-prompt-template
cd monday-ai-prompt-template
npm i
```

Open your .env file and paste your MONDAY_API_KEY token and [OPENAI_API_KEY(https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)] values.

We can now start our development server running:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

In order to connect this app to Monday, you need to create a tunnel to your local environment.

[Install ngrok and sign up for an account (https://ngrok.com/download)].

Then, run the following command:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

This will expose your local server trough a public URL. Save that URL.

<Img alt="Ngrok URL" src="" />

### Connecting to Monday

Go back to your Monday app and add a new feature. Choose the Dashboard Widgets option, then "Start from scratch".

<Img alt="Monday.com create feature" src="" />

Give it a name (e.g Debug Widget) and go to the "Widget Setup" tab. Select "Custom URL" as source, paste your ngrok URL and click on "View URL".

Note: If you restart the ngrok server, the URL will change and you will have to change it here too.

<Img alt="Monday.com Build URL" src="" />

You should be able to see your local app running inside an iframe. This means the app is connected to Monday.com!

<Img alt="Monday.com app" src="" />

Now change the source to Published Build, click on the "New build" button, and add your ngrok URL.

<Img alt="Monday.com Build URL" src="" />

Note: This build is intended for development only, and it will work as long your ngrok is running with the same URL. In other words, everytime you restart your ngrok server, you will have to create a new build with the new URL.

Go now to your app's dashboard, click on App Versions. Click on the three dots of your app's first version, and publish it.

<Img alt="Monday.com publish app" src="" />

Then on your app's dashboard again, click on "Install" on the left menu and then on the "Install app" button.

<Img alt="Monday.com install app" src="" />

Your should now be able to add your app to your Monday board. Go back to your workspace, and open the Bug Insights view on the Bug Queue board, then click on Add Widget -> Apps.

<Img alt="Monday.com add widget" src="" />

Go to Installed apps and add the Debug Widget to the board.

<Img alt="Monday.com add widget" src="" />

You should see the app running inside the widget. Awesome, we are finnaly ready to start coding!

## ðŸš€ Developing the app

Go back to your code editor, and copy the boilerplate file located at monday-ai-prompt-template/src/examples/livestream-example/boilerplate.tsx, then paste it in the same directory and rename it to "debug-assistant.tsx". We will write most of our code logic here.

<Img alt="Debug assistant typescript file" src="" />

Change the component function name from "LivestreamExample" to "DebugAssistant" in line 64 and don't forget to rename the export function too on line 131:

```javascript
const DebugAssistant = ({ initialInput = "" }: Props): JSX.Element => {
    ....
}

export default DebugAssistant;
```

Now open the app's main page located at monday-ai-prompt-template/src/app/page.tsx (since NextJS v13), comment out or remove the <ContextExplorerExample /> component, and add our new DebugAssistant component.

```javascript
...
import DebugAssistant from '@/examples/livestream-example/debug-assistant';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.App}>
    <AppContextProvider>
      {/* <ContextExplorerExample /> */}
      <DebugAssistant />
      {/* <LivestreamExampleFinal /> */}
      {/* <BasePromptLayout /> */}
    </AppContextProvider>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We are going to reuse a lot of the code used by Monday's template, with some tweaks to get it working on our development server.

Go to debug-assistant.tsx, then import dynamic from next and also Monday's Dropdown component:

```javascript
...
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

...

const Dropdown = dynamic(
  () => import("monday-ui-react-core").then((mod) => mod.Dropdown),
  {
    ssr: false,
  }
);
```

Add 2 Dropdown's to your render, one for selecting a board, and the other one for selecting a column. Your rendering section should look like this:

```javascript
...
return (
    <div className={classes.main}>
      <div className={classes.dropdownContainer}>
        <Dropdown
          options={boardGroupsForDropdownComponent}
          onChange={handleGroupSelect}
          placeholder="Select a group"
          size="small"
        />
        <Dropdown
          options={boardColumnsForDropdownComponent}
          onChange={handleColumnSelect}
          placeholder={"Select an output column"}
          size="small"
        />
      </div>
      {canRenderInput && (
        <TextInputWithTagsAndSend
          className={classes.inputContainer}
          onSend={handleSend}
          validTags={boardColumnsForTagsComponent ?? []}
          initialInput={initialInput}
          mode={mode}
          setMode={setMode}
          loading={loading}
          success={success}
          error={error}
        />
      )}
      <div className={classes.footer}>
        <AiAppFooter />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
```

In the getItemsAndColumnValues(), add context?.iframeContext?.boardIds as a fallback value for boardId:

```javascript
...
async function getItemsAndColumnValues(selectedGroup, context, columnIds) {
  return await executeMondayApiCall(
    `query ($boardId:[Int], $columnIds:[String], $groupId: [String]) { boards (ids:$boardId) { groups(ids:$groupId) { items { id column_values (ids:$columnIds) { text id } } } } }`,
    {
      variables: {
        columnIds,
        boardId:
          context?.iframeContext?.boardId ??
          context?.iframeContext?.boardIds ?? // <-- add this line
          [],
        groupId: selectedGroup,
      },
    }
  );
}
...
```

Now add the following to your handleSend() function:

```javascript
const handleSend = useCallback(
  async (input: string) => {
    setMode(Modes.response);

    const columnIds = getColumnIdsFromInputTags(input);

    var itemColumnValuesFromMonday = await getItemsAndColumnValues(
      selectedGroup,
      context,
      columnIds
    );

    if (itemColumnValuesFromMonday.is_success) {
      const { items } = itemColumnValuesFromMonday.data.boards[0].groups[0];
      var prompts: string[] = items.map((item: any) => {
        return replaceTagsWithColumnValues(input, item.column_values);
        // return input
      });
      var itemIdsList: { id: string }[] =
        itemColumnValuesFromMonday?.data.boards[0].groups[0].items.map(
          (x: any) => x.id
        );
    } else {
      showErrorMessage("Failed getting column values from monday", 3000);
      setMode(Modes.request);
      return null;
    }

    const aiApiResponse = await aiApiStatus.fetchData({
      prompts: prompts, // or promptsWithColumnValues,
      items: itemIdsList,
      n: 1, // or itemsFromMonday.length
    });
    if (aiApiResponse.length === 0 || error) {
      showErrorMessage("Something went wrong", 3000);
      setMode(Modes.request);
    } else {
      // avoid GraphQL type errors on dev
      let boardId =
        !context?.iframeContext?.boardId &&
        context?.iframeContext?.boardIds !== null &&
        context?.iframeContext?.boardIds !== undefined
          ? context?.iframeContext?.boardIds[0]
          : context?.iframeContext?.boardId ??
            context?.iframeContext?.boardIds ??
            [];
      // update items on board
      let itemUpdates = aiApiResponse.map(
        async (result: { item: string, result: string }) => {
          return await executeMondayApiCall(
            `mutation ($column:String!,$boardId:Int!, $itemId:Int!, $value:String!) {change_simple_column_value (column_id:$column, board_id:$boardId, item_id:$itemId, value:$value) {id }}`,
            {
              variables: {
                column: outputColumn,
                boardId: boardId,
                itemId: parseInt(result.item),
                value: result.result,
              },
            }
          );
        }
      );
      let success = await Promise.all(itemUpdates);
      setSuccess(!!success);
      setMode(Modes.request);
    }
  },
  [aiApiStatus, selectedGroup, context, outputColumn, error]
);
```

This will send the prompts to OpenAI and then make the GraphQL mutations to update the column we want.

We are almost done. There is a bug on newer versions of NextJS (~13.4.x) related to fetching request on localhost. To circumvent this, open the app/api/openai/route.ts file, and add this at the end:

```javascript
...
export const dynamic = "force-static";
```

This will fix the error, but it will remove the headers from our requests. Lastly, to make our lifes easier during development, we'll skip authentication for now. On route.ts, inside the POST function, comment out the authentication verification:

```javascript
...
export async function POST(req: NextRequest, res: NextResponse) {
  const reqJson = await req.json();
  console.log(`A request was made. \nRequest:${JSON.stringify(reqJson)}`)
  /*if (!isAuthorized(req)) {
    return NextResponse.json({ message: "Not authorized", success: false },
      {status:401});
  } else*/ if (!reqJson.items) {
    return NextResponse.json({'message': 'No items array supplied'}, {
      status: 400,
    })
  }
  else if ...
  ...
}
```

This is fine during development, but you must remember to add the verification again before pushing to product. The changes we just did on route.ts are only necessary to make it all work on our local setting.

We are ready to start testing our app! Go back to Bug Queue -> Bug Insights board on Monday.com, and open the Debug Widget. The new UI should be running inside it. You might need to reload the page.

On the first dropdown select "Incoming Bugs" group, and on the second dropdown select "Suggestions" as output. Then write the following on the text input: "Write a short technical solution for this bug description: @Bug Description" (You should be able to select "Bug Description" after the @). Send the request.

There you go! You should see the Suggestions column being filled up after a few seconds.


## ðŸ¤” Final Thoughts

We learned how to create a Monday app and connect it to an LLM through a local development server. Now you can change the UI, refine the prompts and play with it as much as you want. The sky is the limit! Whenever you fell your app is ready, you should deploy it to a production server and configure it accordingly. That is all for this tutorial, I hope it will help you navigate all the different parts of the Monday.com app framework.
